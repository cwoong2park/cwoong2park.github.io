-   description: My research goal primarily focuses on how data enables cities to overcome urban inequality and inefficiency. I strongly believe that urban data will play a key role in solving urban problems derived from physical and spatial restrictions. For research, I prefer to use Python, GIS, and Bigdata with webcrawling. To analyze data for urban research, I have been equipped with instrumental computer skills, including programming, machine learning, and data science. I am proficient in the fields of urban data science, urban informatics, AI, GIS, and urban computing.
