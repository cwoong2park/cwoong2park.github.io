-   description: I'm focusing on research for how ICT can alleviate urban inequality. I believe that how urban planners and designers utilize ICT and how people accept the technology can solve the unevenly distributed urban resources. I prefer to use Python, GIS and Bigdata with webcrawling for research. To analyze data for urban research, I have been equipped with instrumental computer skills including programming, machine learning and data science. I am proficient in field of Urban Data Science, Urban Informatics, AI, GIS, and Urban Computing.
